      <p>As of Sunday afternoon, The Washington Post called them "occupiers." The New York Times opted
        for "armed activists" and "militia men." And the Associated Press put the situation this way: "A
        family previously involved in a showdown with the federal government has occupied a building at a
         national wildlife refuge in Oregon and is asking militia members to join them." </p>

      <p>Not one seemed to lean toward terms such as "insurrection," "revolt," anti-government
        "insurgents" or, as some on social media were calling them, "terrorists." When a group of
        unknown size and unknown firepower has taken over any federal building with plans and possibly
        some equipment to aid a years-long occupation — and when its representative tells reporters that
        they would prefer to avoid violence but are prepared to die — the kind of almost-uniform delicacy
         and the limits on the language used to describe the people involved becomes noteworthy itself.</p>

      <p>It is hard to imagine that none of the words mentioned above — particularly "insurrection" or
        "revolt" — would be avoided if, for instance, a group of armed black Americans took possession
        of a federal or state courthouse to protest the police. Black Americans outraged about the death
        of a 12-year-old boy at the hands of police or concerned about the absence of a conviction in
        the George Zimmerman case have been frequently and inaccurately lumped in with criminals and
        looters, described as "thugs," or marauding wolf packs where drugs are, according to CNN's Don
        Lemon, "obviously" in use. </p>
